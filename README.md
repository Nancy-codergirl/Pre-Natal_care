## Setup/Installation Requirements




## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/sling254/Pre-Natal_care
$ cd Pre-Natal_care
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ virtualenv2 --no-site-packages env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ cd project
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.










{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
{There is no logout capability from the front end.}

## Technologies Used
- HTML CSS Bootsrap -- front-end
